To add your own sound and text package for the mission generator please follow the instructions below.

*** Check http://www.boardgamegeek.com/files/thing/38453 for files that might already exist ***

To create your own folder pack create a folder under this directory.  That name will be used to display for selection
under preferences menu.  The Files must be named in a particular way and must all be MP3s, which can be referenced below.  The
grammar file must be called grammar.xml and put in the same folder as the MP3s.  There is an example XML file for you to use and 
create your own version located at the same level as this read me.  Any files not added will default to original.
